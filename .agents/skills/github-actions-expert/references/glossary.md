| `pull_request` | PR opened, updated, or merged |
| `schedule` | Cron-based timing |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual trigger via UI/API |
| `repository_dispatch` | External trigger via API |
| `release` | Published release |
| `workflow_call` | Called from another workflow |

## 9.3 Context Objects

| Context | Description |
